# Little Infrastructure Learning As Code 

lilac is a project for Peeanio to share infrastructure practices to the world through an ongoing public project. By keeping configs all public, it should help to limit bad practices by feeling the sharing it to the world.

## Tools Used

### Ansible

Ansible is a swiss army knife for configuration management; working within the framework part way between declarative and imperative, it is possible to write efficient and practical automation for nearly everything under the sun.

### Terraform

Terraform allows for rapid and precise creation of infrastructure declaratively, with an impressive amount of good options. There are some tricks to be aware of, it Terraform needs an informed hand to be run successfully from a maintaince perspective, but it remains a powerful and flexible tool.

## Automated Installs

Automatically install operatins systems to a configured known state allows for a determined infrastructure base that can be as hardened or precise as one needs it to be, but most importantly it is the state the operator wants it to be. Whether it is Debian preseed, cloud-init, or Windows XML, the configurations and how to implement them are contained within.

## Network Designs

Even when designing a network, one can reach for a set of patterns to build off of for an effcient start that gives good design with good flexibility. Discussions and examples are important for NetOps to be confident when creating networks
